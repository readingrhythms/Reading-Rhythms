    <p>
      We may collect contact information such as your name, email address, phone number, and other contact details you provide.
      We may also collect a physical address if needed for purchases/fulfillment or other operational purposes.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p class="font-semibold">B) Identifiers (linked to you)</p>
    <p>
      We may collect identifiers such as a user ID for your account and device/app identifiers (for example, device ID or similar identifiers)
      to provide the service, maintain security, support analytics, and personalize your experience.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p class="font-semibold">C) Location Information (linked to you)</p>
    <p>
      We may collect coarse location information (for example, city/region) if you enable location-based features and grant device permissions,
      such as to recommend nearby events or tailor experiences. You can control location permissions in your device settings.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p class="font-semibold">D) User Content (linked to you)</p>
    <p>
      We collect content you submit through the Services, such as messages, posts, comments, profile text, and any content you send to customer support.
      Community features may allow other users to see content you share.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p class="font-semibold">E) Purchases & Transaction Data</p>
    <p>
      We may collect purchase history and related transaction records (for example, membership status, purchase timestamps, and fulfillment details).
      Payment processing is handled by third-party payment processors or platform providers; we do not store full payment card numbers.
      Depending on how you purchase (web vs. in-app), the platform provider (such as Apple or Google) may process payment information directly.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p class="font-semibold">F) Usage Data / Product Interaction</p>
    <p>
      We may collect information about how you interact with the app (for example, screens viewed, features used, taps/clicks, and session timing)
      to improve performance, understand usage, and personalize recommendations.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p class="font-semibold">G) Log Data, Diagnostics, and Security Data</p>
    <p>
      When you use our Services, we may automatically receive log data such as IP address, device type, operating system, app version,
      timestamps, crash logs, and other diagnostic data to maintain and improve reliability and security.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p class="font-semibold">H) Cookies (Website)</p>
    <p>
      Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect website usage data and improve functionality. Most browsers accept cookies by default.
      You can adjust your browser settings to refuse cookies, but some website features may not function properly if cookies are disabled.

    <br />
    <p id="how-we-use" class="text-xl underline text-center">How We Use Information</p>
    <br />

    <p>We use information we collect for purposes that include:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc mx-12 my-5">
      <li><span class="underline">App functionality</span>: create and manage accounts, provide core features, enable community experiences, and operate events.</li>
      <li><span class="underline">Personalization</span>: tailor book recommendations, community suggestions, and event discovery.</li>

      <li><span class="underline">Legal</span>: comply with legal obligations and protect our rights and users.</li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <p id="sharing" class="text-xl underline text-center">Sharing & Disclosure</p>
    <br />

    <p>We do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances described below.</p>

    <br />
    <p class="font-semibold">A) With Your Consent / At Your Direction</p>
    <p>
      We may share information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party integration or choose to share content within community features.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p class="font-semibold">B) Service Providers (Processors)</p>
    <p>
      We use service providers to help us operate the Services (for example: hosting, authentication, database/storage, analytics, customer support,
      messaging/SMS delivery, moderation tooling, and payment processing). These providers may process information on our behalf subject to confidentiality and security obligations.
      <span class="font-semibold">We use Supabase</span> for mobile backend infrastructure (such as authentication, database, and storage).
      SMS data won’t be shared with anyone except our texting service provider.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p class="font-semibold">C) Other Users (When You Share)</p>
    <p>
      If you use community features, other users may see information you choose to share (such as profile details and messages/posts),
      depending on how the feature is designed and your settings.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p class="font-semibold">D) Legal, Safety, and Protection</p>
    <p>
      We may preserve or disclose information if we believe it is reasonably necessary to comply with law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request;
      to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect Reading Rhythms’ rights or property.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p class="font-semibold">E) Business Transfers</p>
    <p>
      In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, information may be transferred as part of that transaction.
      This Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity, subject to applicable law.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p id="ugc" class="text-xl underline text-center">Community / User-Generated Content</p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Our Services may include user-generated content (“UGC”) such as chat/messages and community posts. We process UGC to provide the service and to help keep the community safe,
      including enforcing our Terms and in-app Community Guidelines and responding to reports.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p>
      <span class="font-semibold">Reporting & blocking:</span> Where available in-app, you can report content/users and block users. You may also contact{" "}

    <br />
    <p id="security" class="text-xl underline text-center">Security</p>
    <br />

    <p>
      We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information.
      Data transmitted to our Services is protected using encryption in transit (for example, HTTPS/TLS).
      No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p id="retention" class="text-xl underline text-center">Data Retention</p>
    <br />

    <p>
      We retain personal information for as long as needed to provide the Services and for legitimate business purposes such as maintaining security,
      complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing agreements. If you request account deletion, we will delete or de-identify information
      associated with your account except where retention is required or permitted by law, and except for limited-period backups.
